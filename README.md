# Shopping Cart Component

This code implements a shopping cart component with two side-by-side boxes:

**Left Box:**

- Displays a list of products with their names, prices, and quantity controls (+ and - buttons).
- Shows the current quantity of each product added to the cart between the buttons.

**Right Box:**

- Displays the cart contents with product names, quantities, and individual prices.
- Calculates and shows the total price of all items in the cart.
- Displays "No Product added to the cart" if the cart is empty.

**Key Features:**

- Leverages separate components for left and right boxes for better organization.
- Maintains an empty cart by default on component load.
- Adds products to the cart on "+" button click and updates their quantities.
- Subtracts products from the cart on "-" button click (handles minimum quantity of 0).
- Calculates total cart price dynamically based on product quantities and prices.
